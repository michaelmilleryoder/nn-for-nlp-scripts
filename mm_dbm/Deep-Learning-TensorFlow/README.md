# Implementation of a Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine with Tensorflow. 
This is a project realized in the course of Probabilistic Graphical Model, Object Recognition and Computer Vision. 

The goal is to implement a Multi-DBM model with Tensorflow. This is inspired from the [paper]( http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4683-multimodal-learning-with-deep-boltzmann-machines.pdf) of Nitish Srivastava et al appeared at NIPS2012. 



The code is built on the top of the [Deep-Learning-Tensorflow](https://github.com/blackecho/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow)
